## Project Overview

This project uses deep learning and image processing techniques to detect diseases in plant leaves. By analyzing leaf images, the model identifies various plant diseases, potentially helping farmers and agriculturalists take timely action to control the spread of diseases.

## Features

- **CNN Model**: A custom-designed CNN to classify plant diseases.
- **Disease Classification**: Identifies multiple diseases based on leaf images.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained and optimized for real-world usage.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the Plant Village dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of diseased and healthy plant leaves. The dataset includes a variety of common diseases affecting plants such as tomato blight, potato rot, etc.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, with several custom layers and blocks to enhance feature extraction. Techniques like data augmentation were used to improve robustness, and transfer learning from a pre-trained backbone (e.g., Xception, ResNet) may have been applied for better accuracy.

### Custom Layers and Blocks

- **CAB Block**: A Convolutional Attention Block (CAB) is used to focus the network's attention on the most critical features.
- **Multi-Scale Feature Fusion**: Integrates features from various scales to capture detailed disease patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
    cd plant-disease-detection
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Download and organize the dataset according to the expected directory structure.

2. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to train the model.

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**: To check the model's performance on the test set:

    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

4. **Predict Diseases**: Use the model to predict plant diseases on new images.

    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
    ```

## Results

After training, the model achieves high accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating its potential for practical disease detection. Sample performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 90%
- **Recall**: 88%
